We are using the free database plan from Heroku which allows up to 14,000 rows. When we get close to the limit we need to summarize the data and
archive it and then delete the data in the database which resets Herokus counters. The steps below describe the process:

Pull the data from the database:
heroku db:pull HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ONYX --app strong-meadow-4887

Run the count_video_views rake task
Export the data:
From Terminal run psql:
psql undergroundmed_development

Then exoirt the db to a csv file (choose a name that matches the rake task name):
\copy viewing_stats to '/Users/rlcohen/Projects/undergroundmed/archived_reports/test.csv';

Put the app in maintenance mode so we can clear the database:
heroku maintenance:on --app strong-meadow-4887

Start postgrsql command line session:
heroku pg:psql HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_ONYX --app strong-meadow-4887

Check the count (there should be a positive number):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM viewing_stats;

Clear the database
DELETE FROM viewing_stats;

Check the count again (it should be 0)

Turn maintenance mode off:
heroku maintenance:off --app strong-meadow-4887

Put the files in the MiniServer/UndergroundMed/Archived Reports folder
